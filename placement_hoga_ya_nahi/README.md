<h4> Purpose of this project: </h4> 
The purpose of this project was to create a predictive model that can accurately(ðŸ¥²) predict the likelihood of job placement.


### Flow of this project

1. Dataset: Hypothetical dataset of 50 students, asked Gemini to make one.

2. Dropped a column named ```Student ID```.

3. Used ```Label Encoder``` on dependent(y) feature/column i.e. ```Placement```.

4. Applied ```Standardization``` on ```CGPA``` and ```IQ```.

5. Split the dataset into training and testing dataset using ```train_test_split``` .

6. Applied ```k-Nearest Neighbor``` & ```Logistic Regression``` algorithms on training dataset.

7. Used testing dataset to ```predict``` the outcome using both the algorithms.

8. Calculated accuracy using ```accuracy_score```  which was ```0.9``` in both the cases.

9. Exported both the models, ```kNN Model``` as ```knn_model.pkl``` and ```Logistic Regression Model``` as ```logistic_model.pkl``` using ```pickle```.

10. Used these models in ```app.py``` to integrate it into the UI which was made using ```streamlit```.
